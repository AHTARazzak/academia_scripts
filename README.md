ALI RAZZAK SCRIPT MADE DURING Theoretical chemistry PhD at UNIVERSITY OF BASEL
For "makerama.py" to be run in Python2.7

Takes sequentially ordered list of dihedral angles so in column 1 x axis sequence and column 2 the dihedral angle. Produces 3D histogram of ramachandran plot and outputs onto customisable GUI.

for "makerama.py"
File takes 2 inputs:
1) Fle containing time series of dihedral angles.
2) Number of bins in raster.

for "2dhistopls.py"
(Much more efficient 3d histogram)
takes 1 input:
1) Fle containing time series of dihedral angles.
